# How to contribute

This is a how-to-contribute guide for the template itself.
This guide is not about contributing to the project that is created
using this template.

## Dependencies

We use `poetry` to manage the [dependencies](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

To install them you would need to run `install` command:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate your `virtualenv` run `poetry shell`.


## Linting

We use `flake8` to run linting.
We use `wemake-python-styleguide` as the main code style rules.
Run:

```bash
flake8 .
```


## Unit tests

We use `pytest` to run unit tests. Run:

```bash
pytest
```
