# This file is required to bind ports in development,
# since binding ports in regular compose file will ruin scaling
# in production. Due to how `ports` directive is merged with two files.
#
# This file is ignored in production, but
# it is automatically picked up in development with:
#
#  $ docker compose up

services:
  web:
    ports:
      # We only bind ports directly in development:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      # We only mount source code in development:
      - .:/code
