# Starting with the docs

We are using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) to manage our documentation.
If you have never worked with `Sphinx` this guide
will cover the most common uses cases.


## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies, [here's how to do it](pages/template/development.rst)
3. Run `cd docs && make html`
4. Open `_build/html/index.html` with your browser


## Where to go next

Read the main page of the opened documentation website. It will guide you.
